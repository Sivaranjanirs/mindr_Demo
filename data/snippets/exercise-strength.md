Title: Strength Training Fundamentals
Key ideas: Train all major muscle groups 2-3 times per week using progressive overload principle.
Weekly structure: 2-3 full-body sessions or 4-5 split sessions, allow 48-72 hours recovery between same muscle groups.
Exercise selection: Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, push-ups, rows target multiple muscles efficiently.
Progression plan: Start with bodyweight, add resistance gradually. Increase weight when you can complete 12+ reps easily.
Rep ranges: 8-12 reps for muscle growth, 3-6 for strength, 12-20 for endurance. Sets: 2-4 per exercise.
Form focus: Quality over quantity. Learn proper technique before adding weight. Consider working with trainer initially.
Recovery needs: Adequate protein (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight), sleep 7-9 hours, hydration, rest days.
Benefits: Increased bone density, improved metabolism, better functional movement, injury prevention.
