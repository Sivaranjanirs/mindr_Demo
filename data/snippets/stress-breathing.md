Title: Breathing Techniques for Stress Relief
Key ideas: Use diaphragmatic breathing, practice regularly, apply during stressful moments for immediate relief.
Basic technique: 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4 counts, hold 7, exhale 8). Activates parasympathetic nervous system.
Box breathing: Inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Used by military and first responders for stress management.
Diaphragmatic breathing: Breathe deep into belly, not chest. Place hand on stomach to feel movement. Practice 5-10 minutes daily.
Quick relief: Three deep breaths anytime you feel stressed. Slower exhale than inhale calms nervous system.
Progressive practice: Start with 2-3 minutes daily, gradually increase to 10-20 minutes. Morning or evening works best.
Mindful breathing: Focus attention on breath sensations, notice when mind wanders, gently return focus to breathing.
Integration tips: Use during commute, before meetings, waiting in line, or any transition time throughout day.
Physical benefits: Lower blood pressure, reduced cortisol, improved heart rate variability, better sleep quality.
