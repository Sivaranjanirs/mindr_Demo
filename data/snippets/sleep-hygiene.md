Title: Complete Sleep Hygiene Guide
Sleep schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Your circadian rhythm thrives on consistency.
Pre-sleep routine: Create a relaxing 30-60 minute wind-down routine including dim lighting, reading, or gentle stretching.
Screen management: Avoid blue light from phones, tablets, and TV for at least 1 hour before bedtime. Use blue light filters if necessary.
Bedroom environment: Keep temperature between 60-67°F (15-19°C), use blackout curtains, minimize noise with earplugs or white noise.
Dietary considerations: Stop caffeine 6-8 hours before bed, avoid large meals 3 hours before sleep, limit alcohol consumption.
Exercise timing: Regular physical activity improves sleep quality, but avoid vigorous exercise within 3 hours of bedtime.
Stress management: Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation before bed.
Sleep duration: Adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night for optimal health, cognitive function, and emotional well-being.
When to seek help: Consult a healthcare provider if you experience persistent insomnia, loud snoring, or excessive daytime fatigue.
