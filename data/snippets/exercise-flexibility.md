Title: Flexibility and Mobility Training
Key ideas: Stretch major muscle groups daily, hold static stretches 15-30 seconds, include dynamic warm-ups.
Daily routine: 10-15 minutes morning mobility, 5-10 minutes post-workout stretching, evening relaxation stretches.
Dynamic warm-up: Leg swings, arm circles, hip circles, light movement before exercise. Prepares muscles for activity.
Static stretching: Best after workouts when muscles are warm. Focus on hamstrings, hip flexors, shoulders, calves.
Problem areas: Desk workers need extra hip flexor, chest, and neck stretches. Address individual tight spots daily.
Breathing technique: Deep, slow breaths during stretches. Never hold breath or force painful positions.
Progressive approach: Start gently, gradually increase range of motion over weeks and months. Consistency over intensity.
Benefits: Reduced injury risk, better posture, decreased muscle tension, improved athletic performance, stress relief.
