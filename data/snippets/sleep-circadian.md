Title: Circadian Rhythm Optimization
Key ideas: Maintain consistent sleep-wake times, get morning sunlight, limit evening light exposure.
Morning routine: Get 10-30 minutes bright light within 1 hour of waking. Natural sunlight or 10,000 lux light box.
Evening protocol: Dim lights 2-3 hours before bed, avoid screens or use blue light filters, create wind-down routine.
Meal timing: Eat largest meals earlier in day, finish eating 3 hours before bedtime. Late meals disrupt circadian clock.
Exercise timing: Morning or afternoon exercise supports healthy circadian rhythm. Avoid vigorous exercise 3 hours before bed.
Travel adjustment: Gradually shift bedtime before travel, use light therapy and melatonin for jet lag recovery.
Shift work strategies: Maintain consistent schedule when possible, use blackout rooms for daytime sleep, consider light therapy.
Age considerations: Older adults often need earlier bedtimes, teenagers naturally shift later, adjust accordingly.
