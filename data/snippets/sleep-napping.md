Title: Strategic Napping Guidelines
Key ideas: Keep naps short (10-30 minutes), nap before 3 PM, use naps to supplement but not replace nighttime sleep.
Optimal timing: Nap between 1-3 PM when natural energy dip occurs, avoid napping after 3 PM to protect nighttime sleep.
Duration guidelines: 10-20 minute "power naps" for alertness, 30 minutes maximum to avoid sleep inertia, 90 minutes for full sleep cycle.
Nap environment: Dark, cool, quiet space, use eye mask and earplugs if needed, set alarm to prevent oversleeping.
Sleep debt management: Use naps to supplement inadequate nighttime sleep, not as primary sleep strategy, maintain consistent bedtime.
Individual factors: Some people are natural nappers, others feel groggy after naps, experiment to find what works for you.
Caffeine timing: Avoid caffeine 6 hours before planned nap, consider "napuccino" (coffee before 20-minute nap) for enhanced alertness.
Professional considerations: Use break times for naps when possible, inform colleagues if napping at work, consider quiet spaces.
Health conditions: Napping may be beneficial for shift workers, new parents, or those with certain medical conditions, consult healthcare provider.
